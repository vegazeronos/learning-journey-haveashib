# Learning Reference from Have A Shib
# Intro
Hi everyone, welcome to my never ending list of learning sources of EVM.
First of all, thanks for read this github, i share everything i learn from what ive experienced

FYI, i am still learning, i learn EVM first on March 2025, so basically I only learn EVM for only 1 year 
(This reference i made it on Feb 2026)

I list all my reference base on level from the basic into the hardest for me. E.g: Level 0 => Basic EVM resource / reference. Level 4 => Harder level of sources. 

Please take notes, this level is base on my experience, and it will always increase along my way of learning.
I choose to use Level because i didnt even know the hardest / the most advanced part of EVM, thats why maybe this references can go to level 100 and so on..

# Level: 0 -> Basic Blockchain (What is Blockchain ?)
I believe the first thing to understand to go deep into this space is to understand what is Blockchain, here is some references that I learn from, either you wanna be a Developer or a Security Researcher:
- [Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/blockchain-basics)
- [Hackquest](https://www.hackquest.io/)
- [Whiteboard Crypto on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@WhiteboardCrypto)

# Level: 1 -> Basic EVM
After those above, I learn the basic of EVM on [Hackquest](https://www.hackquest.io/) first, because i think there's a lot of good stuff here. Anyway, I learn basic EVM from here
- [Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/blockchain-basics)
- [Hackquest](https://www.hackquest.io/)
- [Crypto Zombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course)

This Crypto Zombies is fun, because there's lot of stuff and interactive things to learn. But unfortunately its quite outdated when i last use those. Anyway, its still good to learn basic EVM stuff there imo


# Level: 2 -> Foundry Fundamentals and Full Stack Web3 Development
Next, I learn the fundamental of Foundry, which the most used Framework Solidity used in 2025 (as far as i know). The best place to learn imo is Cyfrin, Patrick (Educator on Cyfrin) really explain it Good, and really fun. Lots of SR (Security researcher) friends of mine recommend to learn here.
- [Cyfrin - Foundry Fundamentals](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/foundry)
- [Cyfrin - Full Stack Web3 Development](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/full-stack-web3-development-crash-course)
- [Hackquest](https://www.hackquest.io/)

The crash course is good imo, because you will know how to make a frontend connected to the blockchain. I also learn the Web3 development on [Hackquest](https://www.hackquest.io/) too. Hackquest will not guide you like Patrick did, but they still did a great job to give another example how web connected with the blockchain.


# Level: 3 -> Advanced Foundry
After learning Fundamental Foundry, I Learn the next level of Foundry, Advanced Foundry.
[Cyfrin - Advanced Foundry](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/advanced-foundry)

Imo, Advanced foundry is another level from Foundry Fundamental. Patrick introduce to a lot of new things on Smart Contract such as
- Upgradeable Contract
- Merkle Tree
- Simple DeFi
- Account Abstraction
- and Fuzzing

# Level: 4 -> Smart Contract Security
On this level, same as above, i learn it on Cyfrin. I thought that this Smart Contract Security is just on this level 4. I was wrong.
[Cyfrin - Smart Contract Security](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/security)


# Level: 5 -> Join Audit Contest
I believe, i start join contest on August 2025, here is the list of all (as far as i know) trusted contest platform
- [Sherlock](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests)
- [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/)
- [CodeHawks](https://codehawks.cyfrin.io/?contestType=all&ended=true&judging=true&live=true&sort=state&upcoming=true)

I include this platform on my learning list of preferences because when i did the contest, i study a lot. Of course this platform will be on my references list.


# Level: 6 -> Fuzzing with Echidna and Foundry
Tho i rarely use it, i learn some of fuzzing technique here:
- [WETH Invariant Testing](https://github.com/horsefacts/weth-invariant-testing)
- [aviggiano Status X](https://x.com/aviggiano/status/1687854387836653569)
- [Thinking in Properties](https://github.com/Certora/Tutorials/tree/master/06.Lesson_ThinkingProperties)
- [Bootcamp Recon](https://book.getrecon.xyz/bootcamp/bootcamp_intro.html)

I already know fuzzing from Cyfrin at Advanced Foundry. So next I think i will start with:
1. WETH invariant testing
2. Thinking in Properties
3. Do the Bootcamp Recon

All the stuff i mention above is free, i learn this like a month, but I decided to focus again on manual review.

# Level: 7 -> Learn Advanced Security Stuff from Guardian Audits
Owen Thurm on his youtube, he share a lot of free stuff and advance security stuff.
[Owen Thurm - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@0xOwenThurm)
[Advance Stuff part 1 (11 hours)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRZogmD647U)

I learn a lot from his playlist, and find lots of interesting stuff. Imo Owen really explain the exploit in a good way, and he explain it with examples, thats why its easy to understand.


# Level: 8 -> Learn from past hacks and try to fork it
To understand more about the exploit and how it happen, i tried to learn from the past hacks. 
[DeFiHackLabs](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs)

Here, they explain create a github to store the past exploit and make the POC.
Before I dive into the past hacks, there's a tutorial how to fork the mainnet, and how to debug from the etherscan and such

There's a lot of stuff to learn here.


# Level: 9 -> ???? 


# Ending
Thanks for read until this bottom, if you like this source, please share it on X or save this github.

Hopefully I will always update this sources of reference of mine, because I believe, learning is a never ending stuff that we need to do, especially in security and especially in Web 3 Security.

God Bless, be safe out there
